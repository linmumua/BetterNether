/**
 * Hands the server the datapacks bundled inside the plugin jar: the BetterNether biome pack and the
 * structure pack.
 * <p>
 * This is the whole delivery mechanism, and it has to be a {@link PluginBootstrap}: biomes and
 * structures are worldgen registries, the worldgen registries are built and frozen inside
 * {@code WorldLoader.load} during {@code Main.main}, and plugins are not loaded until several steps
 * later. The only hook that fires early enough is {@code DATAPACK_DISCOVERY}, which Paper types on
 * {@link BootstrapContext} and nothing else, and only a {@code paper-plugin.yml} can declare a
 * bootstrapper.
 * <p>
 * Both packs are <em>mandatory</em>: without the biome pack the Nether generates with vanilla biomes
 * only, without the structure pack nothing places the Nether City. So a pack that fails to register
 * is not allowed to be a silent no-op. {@link #refusalReason()} carries that failure out of this
 * phase, and the main class must refuse to enable on a non-null answer:
 * <pre>{@code
 * String refusal = NetherDatapack.refusalReason();
 * if (refusal != null) throw new IllegalStateException(refusal);
 * }</pre>
 * A static field is enough to cross the bootstrap/enable boundary because Paper loads both phases
 * through one classloader. The field is volatile: written on the worldgen thread, read on the main
 * thread.
 * <p>
 * The handler is registered unconditionally and is idempotent on purpose: this event fires on every
 * {@code PackRepository.reload()}, and a pack not re-discovered on every fire disappears from the
 * server. A one-shot guard would delete every pack on {@code /reload}; instead each fire recomputes
 * {@link #refusal} from scratch.
