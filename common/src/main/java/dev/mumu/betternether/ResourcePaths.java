/**
 * The single gate every bundled-pack write goes through: which pack-relative paths may be written, and
 * what may already be sitting at the destination.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists as its own class</h2>
 * {@link PackInstaller} and {@link BundledPackUpgrades} both turn a '/'-separated relative path into a
 * file on disk, and both used to do their own ad-hoc checks ({@code contains("..")}, {@code
 * resolve(dir)}, …). Two copies of a security rule drift, and each one misses what the other catches.
 * The rules are therefore stated once here, and both callers must go through {@link #resolve} before
 * writing.
 *
 * <h2>The rules</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Shapes that cannot name a file inside the pack are refused.</b> An absolute path, a drive
 *       letter or NTFS alternate data stream (any {@code :}), a Windows separator ({@code \}), an
 *       empty segment ({@code a//b}, {@code a/}) and {@code ..} are all rejected by
 *       {@link #requireRelative} with a message naming the offending path. Backslashes are refused
 *       rather than silently converted: on Windows {@code a\..\b} would otherwise normalise its way
 *       out of the pack root, and a build-authored path has no reason to carry one.</li>
 *   <li><b>The result must still be inside the root after normalisation.</b> {@link #resolve} resolves
 *       and normalises, then re-checks containment against the real root, so no combination of
 *       segments can escape even if a future rule above is relaxed.</li>
 *   <li><b>No symlink is ever followed out of the pack.</b> Neither the root itself nor any existing
 *       ancestor of the target may be a symbolic link or a non-directory. Without this a link planted
 *       inside the pack (or a {@code resources} folder that is one) would redirect a write to an
 *       arbitrary path on the machine. A DANGLING link is caught too -- {@link Files#exists} reports it
 *       as absent, so {@link Files#isSymbolicLink} is what the check is built on.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>What may already be at the destination</h2>
 * {@link #entryAt} classifies the target <em>without following a final link</em>. Callers use it to
 * keep two different outcomes apart: an existing regular file is the ordinary "already there" case
 * (skipped when only missing files are completed), while a symbolic link -- dangling or not -- or a
 * directory where a file belongs is a contradiction that must be reported as <em>failed</em>. Counting
 * those as "already present, skipped" would silently drop a bundled file on every boot and let the
 * plugin believe the pack is complete.
 *
 * <p>Pure {@code java.nio}, so all of it unit-tests without a server.
