/**
 * The plugin's own text, read from {@code messages.yml} and rendered as MiniMessage.
 * <p>
 * Every string the plugin emits to a human -- console lines and in-game replies -- goes through here
 * so the wording lives in one translatable file instead of being scattered through the code. The file
 * is Chinese by default; keys that are missing fall back to the key name itself, which is ugly but
 * never throws, so a half-translated file degrades instead of breaking startup.
 * <p>
 * The map handed in is the flattened {@code key.path -> value} view produced by
 * {@link ConfigStore}/{@link SafeYaml}; values are expected to be MiniMessage strings.
 * <p>
 * A key a translator left blank ({@code greeting:} with nothing after it) parses to a <b>null
 * value</b>, and a null value is treated exactly like an absent one: it falls back rather than
 * throwing. That is why the copy below is an unmodifiable {@link LinkedHashMap} and not
 * {@code Map.copyOf}, which rejects nulls with an NPE -- one empty line in {@code messages.yml} would
 * otherwise stop the plugin.
